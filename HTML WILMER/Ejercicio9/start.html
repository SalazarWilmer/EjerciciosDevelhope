    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>[Verse 1]
      Fun fact, I'm so, so sick of myself
      My mind's a breeding ground for un-health
      The walls are talkin' and the voices in my head
      (They're screamin' out loud)
      Fun fact, some days, I just cry on the couch
      Put my whole life away on a shelf
      I try to feel something, that's why I break everything
      (I'm screamin' out loud)
      Against the thought of who I'd be if you were me
      And I, I just wanna die
      (Ain't that a fun fact?)
      </p>
      <p>
        [Chorus]
        I've wasted so much time
        Hating myself for trying
        Accepting that this fate is our demise
        Hating myself for lying
        Knew my cards were dealt
        Had your eyes locked on someone else
        No, you couldn't help it
        Or could you?
      </p>

      <p>
          [Verse 2]
          Fun fact, I really wanna fuckin' make you cry
          It just isn't right, so enticing just like you
          Mastermindin' every fight
          Rivers flowin' from my eyes
          No emotion from your side
          Fun fact, I'm the worst, it's true
          Fun fact, I learned it all from you
          I need a coping mechanism now, every night
      </p>
      <p>
            [Chorus]
            I've wasted so much time
            Hating myself for trying
            Accepting that this fate is our demise
            Hating myself for lying
            Knew my cards were dealt
            Had your eyes locked on someone else
            No, you couldn't help it
            Or could you?
          </p>
            <p>[Instrumental Break]</p>
            <p>[Outro]
              You couldn't help it
              No, you couldn't help it
              No, you couldn't help it, no
              Or could you?</p>
